# TechDegreeProject-4

Project #4 utilizes everything learned, through this point, about DOM manipulation and data structures to create a 1 or 2 player game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It also introduced me to JavaScript classes and object-oriented programming as well as the importance of the module pattern when working on large projects. I exceeded expectations on this project by implementing the minimax algorithm to give the single player computer opponent some AI.

### What does it do?

This project allows the user to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend or against the AI. The AI in this game is unbeatable. You may be able to tie the computer, but you can never beat it.
